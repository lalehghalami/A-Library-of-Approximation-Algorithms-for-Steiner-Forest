# A-Library-of-Approximation-Algorithms-for-Steiner-Forest
In the Steiner Forest problem, we are given a set of terminal pairs and need to find the minimum cost subgraph that connects each of the terminal pairs together. Motivated by the recent work on greedy approximation algorithms for the Steiner Forest, we provide efficient implementations of existing approximation algorithms and conduct a thorough experimental study to characterize their performance. We consider several approximation algorithms: the influential primal-dual 2-approximation algorithm due to Agrawal, Klein and Ravi, the greedy algorithm due to Gupta and Kumar, and a randomized algorithm based on probabilistic approximation by tree metrics. We also consider the simplest heuristic greedy algorithm for the problem, which picks the closest unconnected pair of terminals and connects it using the shortest path between the terminals in the current graph. Our analysis reveals that for the majority of instances the heuristic greedy algorithm has the smallest running times and obtains solutions that are close to or better than the solutions obtained by the other algorithms. For instances with a large number of terminals and a large number of edges, the algorithm based on probabilistic approximation by tree metrics has the smallest running time and obtains solutions that have costs closer to the solutions obtained by the other algorithms.
